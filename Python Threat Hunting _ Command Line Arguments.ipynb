    "Python Threat Hunting _ Command Line Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Command line arguments are parameters or options that are passed to a program or script when it is executed via the command line. They let the user of the script modify behavior or configure its settings, typically by providing inputs (e.g. files, strings, the output of another command) or flags (e.g. -h for help). If an input is provided via command line arguments then it is parsed by the script into a usable format and then used somewhere within the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Command line arguments are often used to automate repetitive tasks, configure programs, or to pass inputs that are too complex to be entered via a GUI. They are also used to build more complex scripts and programs that can be executed with a variety of options and inputs, making them more versatile and powerful."
