    "Python Threat Hunting Tools: Part 3 â€” Interacting with APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. It defines a set of rules that allow software applications to interact with each other to exchange data and services. They can be considered a bridge between two applications that allows them to communicate with each other in a standard way.\n",
    "The most common APIs you are likely to interact with are web APIs, which allow you to interact with a web-based application in a programmable manner. APIs can be public (which anyone can use) or private (which are only accessible by authorized parties). Again, most of the time you will use APIs that will require some form of authorization (username & password, token, etc.) as they will relate to an individual account or tenant and be private.\n",

    "We will use Maltiverse free version API and Python 'requests' module to check malicious IP addresses and domains."
